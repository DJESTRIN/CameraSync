<h1> <b> CameraSync </b> </h1>
A Tool kit for simultaneous recording of raspberry pi cameras. The original purpose of this repo was for recording experiments simultaneously across many hours. However, this software can be used for creating custom CCTV security :movie_camera:. 

<h2> Necessary Hardware:</h2>
- <b> Raspberry pi computer(s) </b> :computer:. Preferably raspberry pi 4 and above. Must have ethernet port. 

- <b> Raspberry pi camera(s) </b>:camera:. Preferably high quality cameras.
  
- <b> Network Attached Storage :floppy_disk: </b>

- <b> Ethernet router :fax: </b>

<h1> <b> Example Laboratory Set-up </b> </h1>
A custom built sound attenuated operant chamber for reinforcement learning studies:

A Raspberry Pi was used to record multi-hour long video recordings for various experiments. The code could be modified so recording could be indefinate as seen with CCTV:
