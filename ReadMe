#TMT behavior code
This code is written to virtually control a group of raspberry pi computers for a ~15 behavioral chambers. 
All code is written in Bash or Python. 

The code will be run in the following steps:
(1) ssh_init.sh initalizes the first ssh to verify all the target pis in group
(2) config_pis.sh sequentially controls each pi in group. Each pi is prepared via installing requirements.txt.
(3) RunTMT.sh is ran during actual experiment via TMT.py
(4) ZipSync.sh Zips all relevant data in each pi and sends it to external drive.
