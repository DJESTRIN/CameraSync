#TMT behavior code
This code is written to virtually control a swarm of raspberry pi computers for a ~15 behavioral chambers. 
All code is written in Bash or Python. The primary computer is nicknamed the keeper, all other raspberry pi computers
make up the swarm.

The code will be run in the following steps:
(1) ssh_init.sh initalizes the first ssh to verify all the target pis in swarm
(2) config_pis.sh sequentially controls each pi in swarm. Each computer is prepared via installing requirements.txt.
(3) RunTMT.sh is ran during actually experiment via TMT.py
(4) ZipSync.sh Zips all relevant data in each pi and sends it to external drive.
